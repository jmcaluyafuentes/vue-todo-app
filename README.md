# Vue.js Practice App

This is a simple Vue.js app created as a practice project to learn the basics of the Vue framework. The app is a basic Todo List that allows users to add items dynamically using Vue.js.

## Project Overview

- This project does **not** use a build tool yet.
- The Vue.js library is included via CDN.
- The app consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`) and a JavaScript file (`app.js`).
- CSS is applied using an external `style.css` file.

## Features

- Users can enter a todo item in an input field.
- Clicking the "Add" button adds the entered item to the todo list.
- The list dynamically updates using Vue's reactive data binding.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js 3** (loaded via CDN)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository from GitHub into VSCode.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jmcaluyafuentes/vue-todo-app.git
   ```
   
2. Open the project folder in VSCode.

3. Install the Live Server extension if not already installed.

4. Click the Go Live button in VSCode to serve the app in the browser.

5. Start adding items to the todo list!

## Next Steps

- For the next project, I plan to use **Vite** as a build tool.
- Expand functionality by adding item removal and local storage support.
